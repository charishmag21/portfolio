  description:
    "I am a Data Scientist and AI Engineer with hands-on experience building and deploying machine learning solutions in both industry and research settings. My main focus areas are large language models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, and the end-to-end development of AI applications. I have a strong background in Python, R, SQL, and cloud platforms such as Azure and Google Cloud. I enjoy turning real-world business problems into practical, data-driven solutions—whether that’s automating workflows, building conversational AI, or developing intuitive user interfaces. I am committed to making AI technology useful and accessible, and I am always excited to learn, collaborate, and solve new challenges.",
